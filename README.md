These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
 1.Install selenium. I used pip to install the selenium package.
  pip install selenium 

Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Make sure the driver is in your path, you will need to add your driver_path to the config.json file.
I used the Chrome driver, you can download it here. You can also download Edge, [Firefox] or [Safari]. Depends on your preferred browser.

# Usage
Fork and clone/download the repository and change the configuration file with:
The driver path to your downloaded webdriver.
Run python main.py.
